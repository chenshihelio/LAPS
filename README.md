# LAPS

LAPS (UC**LA**-**P**seudo-**S**pectral) is a 3D MPI-parallelized Fourier-transform-based pseudo-spectral Hall-MHD code writen in FORTRAN, with corotating-expanding-box-model implemented. 

Brief notes on the numerical method are included as a PDF file: /src_compressible/notes_MHD3D_EBM.pdf. Some more detailed description can be found in the paper: https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ab5fce. A thorough description of all the numerical methods along with fundamental tests can be found in the paper: https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fspas.2024.1412905/full.

## Installation & Compilation

To compile the code, MPI and FFTW are necessary. 

### OpenMPI
You can download the latest OpenMPI from https://www.open-mpi.org/software/ompi/v5.0/. The instruction to install OpenMPI can be found here: https://docs.open-mpi.org/en/v5.0.x/installing-open-mpi/index.html.

### FFTW
You can download FFTW from https://www.fftw.org/download.html and install it follow the instruction here https://www.fftw.org/fftw3_doc/Installation-and-Customization.html.

### Compile LAPS
After installing MPI and FFTW, LAPS is ready to be compiled. From terminal, go to the directory of the desired version of the code, i.e. "_/src_compressible_" for 3D compressible version, "_/src_compressible/2D_" for 2D compressible version, "_/src_incompressible_" for 3D incompressible version, and "_/src_incompressible/2D_" for 2D incompressible version. Then run 
> make

The only thing that you may need to modify in "**makefile**" is "**fftwpath**", which by default is "**/usr/local**". You need to change it to the location your FFTW is installed. In addition, depending on the specific FORTRAN compiler you use, you may need to change the "**-r8**" flag in "**OPTIONS**" to "**-fdefault-real-8**". If successfully compiled, a "**mhd.exe**" will be generated.


## Run LAPS

Move "**mhd.exe**" and "**mhd.input**" to the directory in which you want to run the code. All the outputs will be saved in the same directory. Then use the command
> mpirun -np 8 mhd.exe > rec &

to run the code. Here "**-np 8**" specifies that 8 cores will be used, "**> rec &**" tells the program to run in the backend and save all the terminal output to the file "**rec**".

### mhd.input
The "**mhd.input**" is the FORTRAN namelist file. It contains all the input parameters, including number of grid points, domain sizes, CFL condition constant to determine time step size, method for de-aliasing, adiabatic index, resistivity, etc. Most of the parameters have obvious meanings. In addition, the namelist "**&field**" and "**&pert**" specifies the selected case numbers ("**ifield**" and "**ipert**") and associated parameters for the initial condition. 

### mhdinit.f90
Typically, the only ".f90" file that the users need to modify is "mhdinit.f90". In this file, there are two subroutines, namely "subroutine background_fields_initialize" and "subroutine perturbation_initialize", which define the initial background field and initial perturbation respectively. In each of the two subroutines, we have defined six parameters "**ixmin, ixmax, iymin, iymax, izmin, izmax**" which are the ranges of indices of the main array **uu(ixmin:ixmax,iymin:iymax,izmin:izmax,1:8)**. The fourth dimension of **uu**, from 1 to 8, refers to "**rho, Ux, Uy, Uz, Bx, By, Bz, P**" respectively. Note that at initialization, we use the regular MHD fields instead of conserved quantities for convenience. The users may also need to use the spatial coordinates **xgrid(ixmin:ixmax), ygrid(iymin:iymax), zgrid(izmin:izmax)**. Note that, the domain is defined as [0,Lx]x[0,Ly]x[0,Lz].

Sometimes the users may want to modify the **&field** and **&pert** namelists to add their own parameters. These namelists are defined in the main program "**mhd.f90**".


## Read output

Samples of Python scripts to read the output are included.

## TODO

1. Build a better user manual.
2. Implement different time-integral methods.
3. Implement expanding-box-model to the incompressible code.
