# MHD3DSpectral

This is a  fully spectral 3D MHD code writen in FORTRAN, with corotating-expanding-box-model implemented. Brief notes on the numerical method are included as a PDF file here. A more detailed description can also be found in the paper: https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ab5fce

To compile the code, MPI and FFTW are needed.

Samples of Python scripts to read the output are also included.

The code is open-source. You can use it freely but without gurantee.
