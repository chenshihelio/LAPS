# LAPS

LAPS (UC**LA**-**P**seudo-**S**pectral) is a pseudo-spectral 3D Hall-MHD code writen in FORTRAN, with corotating-expanding-box-model implemented. Brief notes on the numerical method are included as a PDF file here. A more detailed description can also be found in the paper: https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ab5fce

To compile the code, MPI and FFTW are needed.

Samples of Python scripts to read the output are included.

The code is open-source and can be used freely. Please cite the following articles if you use the code to generate any publications:
